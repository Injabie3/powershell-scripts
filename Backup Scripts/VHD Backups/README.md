# Backup scripts - Virtual Hard Disks
These scripts allow you to backup your VHDs to other media and send an email notification upon completion.  I was inspired during my first co-op position to implement these in my home testing environment.
The original script is from Michel Stevelmans - http://www.michelstevelmans.com, and was modified to fit my needs.

## Usage
- Download and modify parameters.
- Place the script into a folder.
- Import the XML task file into Task Scheduler, and modify the script path and user.
- Optionally modify the scheduled task execution time.
